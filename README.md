# API Quiz Game

## Description

This project was my API Quiz Game using API's and javascript. My motivation for this project was to familairize myself with different API's and make myself more comfortable using the DOM. It allowed me to continue to practive the use of Javascript to added functionality to the webpage. This exercise really tested my ability to use computational thinking to break down each part of the game in order to make it work as a whole. The completion of this project has further familiarized myself with the use of javascript and its syntax.
